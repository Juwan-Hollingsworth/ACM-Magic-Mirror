# ACM-Magic-Mirror
An ACM funded technology project exploring the use cases of the Raspberry Pi in the college ecosystem. Magic Mirror is a touch screen responsive mirror powered by a Raspberry Pi backend and open source OS.  Built using a defective 32" TV found in Clayton State's robotics lab. ACM members thought it would be cool to repurpose this technology with hopes of benefiting the college.
